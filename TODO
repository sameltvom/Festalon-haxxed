Disable expansion sound channels when PAL emulation is active.

Fix volume levels of expansion sound chips, and see if their DACs exhibit
any non-linearity.  Also implement a global volume-lowering effect for
all expansion sound chips(they have a resistor across the audio in and audio 
out)...

Modularize the sound code, especially the expansion sound chips, to allow for multiple
Festalon "objects", and to also allow for multiple expansion sound chips per NSF.
