0.3.0:	Re-forked off of FCE Ultra 0.98.x.  Sound emulation is greatly improved, but
	there could still be some quirks.  The sound code is rather messy right now, and
	will need to be cleaned(I need hired monkey cleaners).

0.2.4:
	Cleaned up the Makefiles.

	Updated the TODO.

	Replaced the inline assembly in filter.c with better(on my computer)
	C code.

0.2.3:
	Fixed channel disable support for the Namco 106 sound channels.

0.2.2:
	All:  Updated FDS sound code from FCE Ultra 0.93.
	All:  Rewrote pieces of Namco 106 sound emulation code to be more 
	      accurate(including aliasing that is present on the real thing).
	xmms: Added support for pausing the song.

0.2.1:  
	All:  Reimplemented a cpu speed hack.
	All:  Simplified post-downsampling high-pass filter.
	All:  Modified the way the sound channels are mixed, to be more accurate.
	All:  Adjusted volume of VRC6 and VRC7 expansion sound channels.
	All:  Raised default volume to 200%, if that means anything now. :)
	All:  Modified FDS sound emulation.  It's still not right, though.
	All:  Deobfuscated triangle wave linear counter emulation.
	UNIX: Fixed 96KHz playback.
	Winamp: Increased the maximum value of the volume trackbar
		to 250%.

0.1.3:
	All:  Updated README in source code archive.
	Console:  Usage information is now disabled if no filename(s) is(are)
		  provided.
	Console:  Added a time counter.
        Winamp:  Added support for DSP/effects plugins.
        Winamp:  Various minor bugs fixed.
        Winamp:  An installer is now used for the binary release.
        xmms:  Fixed a few major bugs.

0.1.2:
        All:  Default volume changed to 175%.
        All:  Simplified post-downsampling filters.
        All:  Added support for 96KHz playback rate.
        Console:  Version is now printed on startup.
        Winamp:  Updated reported version number.
        Winamp:  Added an internal volume control trackbar.
        Winamp:  The last played song will be played whenever an NSF
                 is stopped and then played again.

0.1.1:
	Removed a CPU emulation speed hack that was messing up sound
	emulation.  It may be readded in the future once I figure out how
	to implement it correctly, as it gave a nice speed boost.
	
	Console interface status line is only updated when necessary, not
	50-60 times a second.

	FME-07, MMC5, and Namco 106 extra sound channels can now be disabled.
	
	Installed sigint and sigterm signal handlers to restore the terminal
	in the console iface for the ctrl-c crazy folk.  Also cleaned up
	multiple file loading code.

	usleep() is used in xmms plugin now.  Other minor changes.  Still
	needs work.


0.1.0:
	First release.
